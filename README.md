# Research 3D Models for StateLens (UIST 2019)

This is the 3D Model repository for `StateLens: A Reverse Engineering Solution for Making Existing Dynamic Touchscreens Accessible`. It contains the models that were used in the publication to enable risk-free exploration on dynamic touchscreens. [More information about the work can be found here](https://mikeriv.com/research/statelens/).

The [publication is also freely available here](https://mikeriv.com/assets/research/statelens/uist19-statelens.pdf).

Note that the conductive stylus in the figure above must either be painted with [conductive ink](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1306) (in the black regions as seen above) or be printed with [conductive PLA](https://www.proto-pasta.com/products/conductive-pla)  to function correctly.
